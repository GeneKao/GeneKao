### Hi I'm Gene! :wave: :grin: 

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/GeneKao/GeneKao/blob/master/mikeMU.gif" height="150" width="150">

I'm a designer, researcher, engineer, and programmer who specialises computational design, digital fabrication in architecture 🏛 and visual computing in computer science 💻.

I believe interdisciplinary research boosts innovation. My passion is combining computation and mathematics with design and fabrication. I received a [CAS in Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/continuing-education/certificate-program.html) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), an MSc in [Integrative Technologies and Architectural Design Research](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/study/study-programs/Integrative-Technologies-and-Architectural-Design-Research-ITECH-M.Sc-00002./) at Stuttgart University, and BArch at Tamkang University. I worked in software development and R&D in both Germany 🇩🇪 and Taiwan 🇹🇼.

I'm currently a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Technology in Architecture](https://ita.arch.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich 🇨🇭, where I'm a research assistant in [Block Research Group](https://block.arch.ethz.ch/brg/) and [NCCR Digital Fabrication](https://www.dfab.ch/), supervised by [Prof. Philippe Block](https://block.arch.ethz.ch/brg/people/philippe-block) and co-supervised by [Prof. Stelian Coros](http://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html).
